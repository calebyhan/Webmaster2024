        <p>Natural fossil fuels are a finite resource used to power our economies and daily lives. The foundation of the modern world has build itself around the use of fossil fuels. Currently, the US recieves 81% of its total energy from oil, coal, and natural gas (The Natural Academies). The graph shows the increasing trend of dependence in fossil fuels as our source of energy, as projections of the use of petroleum and natural gas shows an increasing trend. However, there is a simultaneous projection in the increase of renewable energy sources (Hidy). Unfortunately, the world needs to step up renewable energy production and capacity to meet the demands of the future. According to International Energy Agency's Executive Director Fatih Birol, “Between now & 2030, we need to double energy efficiency progress & triple renewable capacity. These are the pillars of the clean energy transition.”
